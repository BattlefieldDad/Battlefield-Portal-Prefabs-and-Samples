Silly little bit of code I wrote when working on the BR ring code. Would probably update (I wrote this when the AI slider was a bit broken and I would probably do it again a lot more efficiently.
This sort of technique was used in the wing suit trainer and with some tweaking could be used for a variety of other things.
May come back to this as I have some ideas on how this could be used to create some interesting modes!
