# Battlefield-Portal-Prefabs-and-Samples
If you use any of these blocks please attribute myself and share my youtube channel. Its all I ask and is greatly appreciated.

For my youtube channel for all things Battlefield 2042 Portal, please visit https://www.youtube.com/c/BattlefieldDad

If you come across this Github while searching, I will have it organised properly 'soon' (c). Just backing up and organising at the moment!

A list of useful code samples to use in battlefield portal projects. Some have been cleaned up and some are just backups of key blocks that may be useful in other projects. Many of these samples have been used in existing projects on my youtube channel.
