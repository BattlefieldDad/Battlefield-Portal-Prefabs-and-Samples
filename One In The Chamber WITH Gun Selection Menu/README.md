This is an advanced version of One In the Chamber style mode. One shot kills. Ammo replenished on kill.
With this one I added a gun menu on first spawn. This allows weapon choice when game is entered.
Select gun based on category then start game.
The advantage with this is it can be shared and run by anyone and guns can be disabled in the menu, only selected and then assigned to everyone the same in the game. AI would probably be okay with this one as they will have no gun because it will be disabled then assigned in code.

The menu here is a good foundation that could be used in other modes - TDM?
Would be useful if attachments could be added through code as well!
