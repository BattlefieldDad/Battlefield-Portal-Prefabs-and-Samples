Very simple example of in game messages showing who killed who in the game.
Shows who killed you, who you killed and displays in game message to everyone.
Because the game mode message displays for 6 seconds its usually not a good idea to overuse it as messages stack - so you could get a constant rotation of out of time messages. But as an example here it demonstrates how it works.
